  Slice -- Extract out pre-defined slices of an ASCII file

  Version 1.2.8 (12-12-1997)

  The slice program reads an inputfile and divide its prepaired ASCII contents
  into possibly overlapping slices. These slices are determined by enclosing
  blocks which are defined by begin and end delimiters which have to be
  already in the file.   The final output gets calculated by a slice term
  consisting of slice names, set theory operators and optional round brackets.

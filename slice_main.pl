##    Slice -- Extract out pre-defined slices of an ASCII file
##
##    The slice program reads an inputfile and divide its prepaired ASCII contents
##    into possibly overlapping slices. These slices are determined by enclosing
##    blocks which are defined by begin and end delimiters which have to be
##    already in the file.   The final output gets calculated by a slice term
##    consisting of slice names, set theory operators and optional round brackets.
##
